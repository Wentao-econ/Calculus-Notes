# Calculus-Notes
This repository contains my notes of Calculus. The rigor of these mathematics notes reaches the level of analysis, meaning they are suitable for both engineering (or social science) students and pure mathematics students.

The content of these notes is exceptionally comprehensive and detailed, starting from first-order logic and culminating with Fourier transforms and Laplace transforms. It covers many nuanced topics that other calculus textbooks or notes often omit, such as discussions on the hierarchy of infinity in naive set theory, the ZFC axioms, the completeness of spaces and their completions, and more.

These notes are still being updated on an irregular basis, primarily to supplement each chapter with high-quality exercises, refine certain details in the main text, and correct any typos or errors. (Currently, this set of notes is only available in Chinese; an English version will be uploaded within the next year.)
